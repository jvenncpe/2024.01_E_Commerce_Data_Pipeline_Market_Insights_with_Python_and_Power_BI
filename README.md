# E-Commerce Data Pipeline and Competitive Insights with Python and Power BI
Analyzed Amazon e-commerce data, cleaned, and imported to SQL Server with Python. Developed a Python script for web scraping competitors, storing data in a staging table before cleaning and moving to production. Created a Power BI dashboard and a machine learning model to predict freight costs.

### Summary:
</br>Data Collection and Analysis:
</br>• Utilized historical data from an e-commerce store on Amazon for analysis and visualization.
</br>• Cleaned and imported this data into SQL Server using Python.
</br></br>Web Scraping and Data Management:
</br>• Developed a Python script to scrape current market competition.
</br>• Initially stored the web-scraped data in a staging table, then cleaned it and moved it to a production table.
</br></br>Data Visualization and Analysis:
</br>• Connected data from SQL Server to Microsoft Power BI Service for publishing and online access.
</br>• Power BI accessed SQL Server: historical data via import and cleaned web-scraped data in the production table via direct query.
</br>• Developed a Power BI dashboard to visualize both historical and web-scraped data.
</br></br>Predictive Modeling:
</br>• Created a machine learning model to predict freight costs.
