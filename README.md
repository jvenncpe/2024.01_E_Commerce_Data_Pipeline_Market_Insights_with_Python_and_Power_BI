# 2024.01_E_Commerce_Data_Pipeline_Market_Insights_with_Python_and_Power_BI
Analyzed Amazon e-commerce data, cleaned, and imported to SQL Server with Python. Developed a Python script for web scraping competitors, storing data in a staging table before cleaning and moving to production. Created a Power BI dashboard and a machine learning model to predict freight costs.

Data Collection and Analysis:
• Utilized historical data from an e-commerce store on Amazon for analysis and visualization.
• Cleaned and imported this data into SQL Server using Python.
Web Scraping and Data Management:
• Developed a Python script to scrape current market competitors.
• Initially stored the web-scraped data in a staging table, then cleaned it and moved it to a production table.
Data Visualization and Analysis:
• Connected data from SQL Server to Microsoft Power BI Service for publishing and online access.
• Power BI accessed SQL Server: historical data via import and cleaned web-scraped data in the production table via direct query.
• Developed a Power BI dashboard to visualize both historical and web-scraped data.
Predictive Modeling:
• Created a machine learning model to predict freight costs.
